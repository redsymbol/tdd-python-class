Notes for a mini-class on test driven development in Python 3

# Setup

Install Python 3.4 or later on your machine. (Note that it safely
installs alongside Python 2.)

Also, you will want to be able to run python scripts from the command line, as you'll
be typing things like "python -m unittest test_foo.py".
For Windows, you may need to do some extra work - see http://goo.gl/m0cbM for the steps.
